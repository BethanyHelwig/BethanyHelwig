### Welcome, traveler!

I am a recent software developer graduate and like to sample everything on the menu from Java, to Unity, to 3D modeling. I take great joy in creation, whether that be a business application, mobile app, graphics, or a game. 

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving into React, Next.js, and Typescript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write novels as a hobby and want to create a game based off my books in the near future.
